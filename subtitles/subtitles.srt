00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,779
 As I look back on the mission that we've had here on the International Space Station,

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:13,320
 I'm proud to have been a part of much of the science activities that happened over the

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
 last two months.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,199
 The view is always amazing though.

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,280
 I didn't think I would do another spacewalk and to now have the chance to have done four

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,120
 more was just icing on the cake for a wonderful mission.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:37,480
 It's hard to put into words just what it was like to be a part of this expedition, Expedition

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
 63.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,280
 It'll be kind of a memory that will last a lifetime for me.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,120
 It's been a true honor.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,880
 Dragon SpaceX, Undock sequence commanded.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,359
 The roster's looking good.

13
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,520
 The hardest part was getting us launched, but the most important part is bringing us

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
 home.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,560
 I've been telling Daddy we love you.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:06,480
 Hurry home so we can go get my dog.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
 Flashdown.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,879
 Welcome back to planet Earth and thanks for flying SpaceX.

19
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,400
 It's truly our honor and privilege.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:30,040
 SpaceX dads are back on Earth after a 19 hour return journey from space.
